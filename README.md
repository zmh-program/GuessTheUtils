# GuessTheUtils
GuessTheUtils is a Fabric 1.21.6 utility mod for the Guess The Build game mode on the Hypixel server.
## Features
- **Custom Scoreboard:** When the mod detects that you're in a GTB game, it will replace the vanilla scoreboard with a custom one, which gives you additional information on each player, such as build state, leaver / inactive state, title, emblem, points gained during round, and total points. Holding the Player List Key (TAB by default) will expand the scoreboard to show even more information.
- **Shortcut Reminders:** Whenever a theme is revealed, the mod will send a message in chat to remind you of any shortcuts that work for that theme.
- **Builder Notifier:** If it's your turn to build, but Minecraft is minimized or not in focus, a desktop notification will call you back.
- **Name Autocomplete:** Now all player's names can be autocompleted with the TAB key, not just the current builder.
- **Disallowed Item Hider:** Disallowed items from versions 1.9 and above will be hidden from the creative menu, only in Guess The Build.
- **Chat Cooldown Timer:** If you have a chat cooldown, a timer will appear on your screen, and a bell sound will play when you're allowed to guess again.

## FAQ
### Q: 1.8?

### Q: I found a bug!
A: Open a new issue, or contact me, `aembr`, on Discord directly.
### Q: Can you add X feature?
A: If you do have an idea you think could be useful, that I haven't implemented yet, open a new issue or DM `aembr` on Discord.
