# GuessTheUtils
GuessTheUtils is a Fabric 1.21.6 utility mod for the Guess The Build game mode on the Hypixel server.
## Features
### Custom Scoreboard
When the mod detects that you're in a game of Guess The Build, it will replace the vanilla scoreboard with a custom one, which gives you additional information on each player:

- Build state indicator (who has built, who's building, and who is yet to build)
- Leaver / inactive status
- Title, rank, and emblem
- Points
- Points gained in the current round

### Shortcut Reminders
Whenever a theme is revealed, the mod will send a message in chat to remind you of any shortcuts that work for that theme.

### Builder Notifier
If it's your turn to build, but Minecraft is minimized or not in focus, a desktop notification will call you back.

### Name Autocomplete
Now all player's names can be autocompleted with the TAB key, not just the current builder.

### Disallowed Item Hider
Disallowed items from versions 1.9 and above will be hidden from the creative menu, only in Guess The Build.

## FAQ

### Q: 1.8?
A: Not planned. I only plan to support latest, and only port it to newer versions when Hypixel stops supporting the current one. If you have the skills however, feel free to use my bad code however you wish.

### Q: I found a bug!
A: Open a new issue, or contact me, `aembr`, on Discord directly.

### Can you add X feature?
A: If you do have an idea you think could be useful, that I haven't implemented yet, open a new issue or DM `aembr` on Discord.
